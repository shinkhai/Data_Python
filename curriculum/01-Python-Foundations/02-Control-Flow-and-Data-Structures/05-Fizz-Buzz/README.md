You can learn more about it on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).

Beside being a children game, `Fizz Buzz` has also grown quite famous as a programming exercise. So much that peole have actually been using it as an example for:

## Guidelines
That's pretty simple, you need to implement a program that will play `Fizz Buzz` from 1 to 100. Print out the numbers from 1 to 100, if the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead, but if the number if divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead, and if divisible by both, print "Fizz Buzz".
