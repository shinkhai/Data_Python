## Objectives
* Manipulate lists

In this module, we will play a bit with lists and compute some statistics for
NBA players.

## Guidelines

We have a list of NBA players, and a list of the average points they got during
the season. The 2 lists are ordered in the same way, e.g. index `n` in one list
correspond to index `n` in the other one.

You'll have to do 3 things:
### 1. Print out the total number of points
Let's say the total number of points is 84, you should print it out this way.
```
Total number of points: 84"
```
### 2. Print out the name of the best player
E.g. the one with highest average points. Let's say it's LeBron James:
```
Best player: LeBron James
```

### 3. Print out the list of the players
Order them by their score in descending order.
For example
```
['James Harden', 'Anthony Davis', 'LeBron James']
```

## General tips
Open the `nba_stats.py` file and implement the program.

## Bonus
What would happen if 2 players had the same number of points? Would your
implementation still work?
